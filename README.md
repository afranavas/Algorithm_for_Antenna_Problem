Hybrid ANN-SVM Model for S-Parameter Prediction

Introduction
The prediction of S-parameters is crucial in the design and analysis of antenna systems. Accurate prediction models help in optimizing antenna performance and reducing experimental costs. This report details the development and evaluation of a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict S-parameters. This approach leverages the strengths of both ANN and SVM to enhance prediction accuracy.

Methodology
Data Preparation
Two datasets were used in this study: Training_Data.mat for training and Real_Test_Data.mat for testing. The data consists of geometrical variables and S-parameter responses. The following steps outline the data preparation process:

Loading Data: The datasets were loaded using the scipy.io library in Python.
Normalization: The geometrical variables were normalized using StandardScaler from the sklearn library to ensure that the features are on a similar scale.
Response Flattening: The S-parameter responses, initially nested, were flattened for easier processing.
Model Development
ANN Model
An ANN was designed to predict the intermediate S-parameter responses:

Architecture: The model consisted of an input layer matching the number of geometrical variables, two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons respectively, and an output layer matching the dimension of the S-parameter responses.
Training: The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function for 100 epochs with a batch size of 10 and a validation split of 20%.
SVM Model
Using the intermediate predictions from the ANN, separate SVM models were trained for each dimension of the S-parameter responses:

Kernel: A linear kernel was used for the SVM models.
Training: Each SVM model was trained using the intermediate ANN predictions as features and the flattened S-parameter responses as targets.
Evaluation
The performance of the hybrid ANN-SVM model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R-squared (R^2) score. Additionally, the predicted S-parameters were visually compared to the actual responses using plots.

Results
Model Performance
The performance metrics for the hybrid ANN-SVM model are summarized below:

Visual Comparison
The following plots compare the actual and predicted S-parameters for the first dimension:


The plots demonstrate that the hybrid ANN-SVM model captures the overall trend of the S-parameter responses with reasonable accuracy.

Discussion
The hybrid ANN-SVM approach combines the capability of ANN to model complex, non-linear relationships with the robustness of SVM for regression tasks. The intermediate predictions from the ANN serve as informative features for the SVM, enhancing the overall predictive performance. The results indicate that the hybrid model performs well in predicting the S-parameters, as evidenced by the MSE and R^2 metrics.

However, there are some limitations to this approach. The choice of hyperparameters for both the ANN and SVM can significantly impact performance, and further optimization may yield better results. Additionally, the model's performance should be validated on a wider range of test data to ensure its generalizability.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a hybrid ANN-SVM model in predicting S-parameters for antenna design. The combined approach leverages the strengths of both machine learning techniques, resulting in accurate predictions as validated by the performance metrics and visual comparisons. Future work could explore hyperparameter optimization and validation on additional datasets to further improve and validate the model's performance.
